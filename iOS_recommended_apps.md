# Tutorial Doctor's Recommended IOS Apps (WIP)

There are three main criterion I use to rate an app: USEFULNESS -- STABILITY -- DESIGN.

USEFULNESS* is basically how useful an app is TO YOU. What is useful to one may not be as useful to another. I give usefulness a maximum score of 2 OUT OF FIVE STARS.

STABILITY/RELIABILITY is simply how STABLE/RELIABLE an app is. An app might have a useful purpose, but the EXECUTION might be poor. The app could crash or LAG. Maximum score: 2 OUT OF FIVE STARS.

DESIGN is how INTUITIVE/PRETTY an app is. However, if it is useless/unreliable, it is not worth the space. Max score: 1 OUT OF FIVE STARS.

If an app is useful or reliable HALF of the time, it gets HALF the score. So an app might be reliable every time, but only useful half the time. It would get 3 stars. If the design is good -- 4 stars.

*This list will grow over time.*
