# Tutorial-Doctor-Tutorials
A collection of tutorials & guides on random topics I find interesting.

I research these topics before writing a tutorial to find the best way of many ways to communicate the subject to the reader. I am not an authority on these subjects. If there is any misinformation please notify me with an issue and I will research it again.
